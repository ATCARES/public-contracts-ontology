# Linking: Legal regulation #

## Description ##

Legal regulations are the legally binding documents controlling and guiding public procurement. Linking to the legal rules and conditions stating what is required to participate in public procurement in various legal systems may be useful from perspectives of both contracting authority and supplier. Suppliers might be interested in knowing what they need to comply with in order to enter a specific tender. For instance, they might want to know what certificates are required from the supplier or how can their companies qualify to compete for a contract. On the other hand, representatives of contracting authorities might find useful to know the consequences of legal regulations on the types of information that must be disclosed publicly or if it is obligatory to submit the contractâ€™s notice into central registries of public procurement, such as TED. Having this kind of auxiliary information may help to reduce the complexity of cross-country procurement.
