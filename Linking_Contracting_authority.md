# Linking: Contracting authority #

## Description ##

Contracting authority is a publicly funded institution issuing public contracts. This public sector body may have links to the appointed politicians and civil servants it employs, which are especially important from the transparency perspective. Links of this type may indicate undesirable connections between the members of an authority and the owners of companies tendering for the authorityâ€™s public contracts. Contact information for an authority should be provided using an instance of `vcard:VCard` and linked via the `pc:contact` property. For modelling of contracting authorities and their associated contact information see the cookbook: [contracting authority](Cookbook_Contracting_authority.md) and [contact](Cookbook_Contact.md).
