## Description ##

Models a tender, which is an offering of an interested supplier to a public contract.

## Modelling patterns ##

A tender to a public contract is represented as an instance of `pc:Tender`. It is a resource with own HTTP(S) URI. The supplier who proposes the tender is an instance of `gr:BusinessEntity` and is assigned to the tender by the property `pc:supplier` (see [Supplier](Cookbook_Supplier.md) for more details). The price offered by the supplier is expressed as an instance of `gr:PriceSpecification` and is assigned to the tender by the property `pc:offeredPrice` (see [Price](Cookbook_Price.md) for more details). If the date of the tenderâ€™s submission is known, it can be specified using the `dcterms:dateSubmitted` property.

We attach the tender to the contract using the `pc:tender` property. The awarded tender is attached using the `pc:awardedTender` property.

A tender (as well as _sub-tender_) may be further specified by an optional title and description using properties `dcterms:title` (or `rdfs:label`) and `dcterms:description`, respectivelly.
