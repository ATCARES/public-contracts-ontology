# Linking: Payment #

## Description ##

Every public contract has associated payments outgoing from the account of contracting authority. However, in most cases, the connections with the payments are not explicitly recorded. Given the current state of affairs it is difficult to uncover the correspondencies between suspicious payments and public contracts and discovering their influence on income statements of authorities issuing the contract. Making these links more explicit and traceable serves as an effective way to increase transparency of the public sector and enforce accountability of civil servants.

## Datasets ##

  * Some countries provide data on aggregated public budgets categorized into coarse classification schemas. However, aggregated data is not as useful as having access to individual payments that can be directly assigned to a public contract. Public spending on the level of individual payments and in RDF is much less common, however, there are some countries pioneering this approach to public disclosure, namely the United Kingdom.
